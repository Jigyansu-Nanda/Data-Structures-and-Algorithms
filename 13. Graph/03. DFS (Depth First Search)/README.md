# DFS (Depth First Search)
DFS is a Graph Traversal Algorithm, that considers a source, visit it's adjacent, then recursively call DFS on that and so on. In DFS, we visit Depth wise like recursion.

## Application of DFS
 - Cycle Detection
 - Topological Sorting
 - Strongly Connected Components
 - Solving Maze and similar puzzles
 - Path Finding
