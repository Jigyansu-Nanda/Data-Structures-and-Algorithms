# Spanning Tree
A spanning tree of a connected and undirected graph is a subgraph, that is a tree and connects all the vertices together (not necessarily directly, maybe through some intermediate edges).

## Minimum Spanning Tree
  - A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree of a weighted, connected and undircted graph is a spanning tree, with weight of all edges, less than or equal to all possible spanning trees for that graph.
  - **A Minimum Spanning Tree has (v-1) edges, where v = number of vertices in the graph**
  
## Algorithms for finding MST
 - Prim's MST algorithm
 - Kruskal's MST algorithm
