# Floyd Warshall Shortest Path Algorithm
  - Floyd Warshall **All-Pair-Shortest-Path (APSP) algorithm** is a dynamic programming based algorithm, that computes shortest distances between all possible pair(source, destination) of vertices. 
  - This algorithm is relatively slower than even Bellman Ford algorithm. For even slightly higher number of vertices this algorithm takes quite some time to compute all pair shortest paths.
  - The crucial advantage of this algorithm is that, after computation, it gives shortest paths among all possible pairs of source and destination vertex, iff path exists.
