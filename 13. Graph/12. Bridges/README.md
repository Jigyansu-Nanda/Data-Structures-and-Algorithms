# Bridges in a Graph
  - A bridge is defined as an edge which, when removed, makes the graph disconnected (or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph).
  - The algorithm used here is very similar to finding Articultion Points. It is strongly recommended to read Articultion Points before proceeding further.
