# BFS (Breadth First Search)
BFS is a Graph Traversal Algorithm, that considers a source, traverses all vertices one edge away from it, then all vertices two edges away from it and so on.

# Application of BFS
 - Shortest Path in an un-Weighted Graph
 - Crawalers in Search Engine
 - Peer-to-Peer Networks
 - Garbage Collection (Cheney's Algorithm)
 - Cycle Detection in Graph
 - Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
 - Broadcasting
