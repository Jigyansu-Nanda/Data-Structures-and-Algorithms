# Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be __LIFO(Last In First Out)__ or __FILO(First In Last Out)__.

## Application
 - Function calls
 - Checking for balanced parenthesis
 - Reversing items
 - Infix to Prefix/Postfix
 - Evaluation of Prefix/Postfix
 - Stock Span problems & it's variations
 - Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop
 - Forward and backward feature in web browsers

## Generic Stack Implementation
 - [using Array of user-defined capacity](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/07.%20Stack/1.%20Generic%20Stack%20Implementation/3.%20Generic%20Stack%20using%20array%20of%20user%20defined%20capacity)
 - [using ArrayList](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/07.%20Stack/1.%20Generic%20Stack%20Implementation/1.%20Generic%20Stack%20using%20ArrayList)
 - [using LinkedList]()
