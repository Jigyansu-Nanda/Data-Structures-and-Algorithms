# Sorting Algorithms
 Different sorting algorithms are available with differing time, space and memory-writing efficiency.
 
## Stability in Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is called stable, if the elements/items, having same value appear in the same order after being sorted, as they were in the original array/collection.
 - **Stable sorting algorithms:** *Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort*
 - **Unstable sorting algorithms:** *Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort*
 
## In-place Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is known to be in-place, if no extra space is required for sorting purpose.
 - **In-place sorting algorithms:** *Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Block-Merge Sort*
 - **Not In-place sorting algorithms:** *Merge Sort*
